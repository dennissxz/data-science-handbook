# Linear Programming

A linear programming problem consists of three elements

- $n$ variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$

- one objective function that is linear in variables

$$
\max/\min \ c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 \ldots c_n x_n
$$

- $m$ constraints that are linear in variables

$$a_{j1}x_1 + a_{j2}x_2 \ldots + a_{jn}x_n \ (\ge \text{or}  \le \text{or}  =) \ b_j$$

Note that linear programming may not return integer solutions.
