# Machine Learning Basics



For each model, we introduce

- Objective
  - What is the structural form of the model
  - What quantity to optimize

- Learning
  - Aka training, fitting, estimation
  - How to train a model capable for prediction

- Properties
  - Properties of the model

- Model Selection
  - How to select a good hyperparameter

- Interpretation
  - The logic behind the model
  - The parameter of the model
  - The results of the model

- Extension
  - Variants of the model
