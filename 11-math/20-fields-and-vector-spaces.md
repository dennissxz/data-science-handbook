# Fields


A field is a set $F$ with addition and multiplication, which satisfies the following

- Commutativity
- Association
- Additive and multiplicative identity
- Additive inverse
- Multiplicative inverse

Examples of fields: $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{F}_{2}, \mathbb{F}_{p}$ ($p$ is a prime).


# Vector Spaces

A vector space over field $F$ is a set $V$ associated with operations addition and scalar multiplication that satisfies the following

- Association of addition
- ...

Examples:
- $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$

# Inner Product Spaces

An inner product space is a vector space $V$ over the field $\mathbb{F}$ **together** with a map $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ that satisfies

- Linearity

- Conjugate symmetry

- Positive definite
