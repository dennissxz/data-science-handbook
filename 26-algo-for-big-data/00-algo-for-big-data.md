# For Big Data

Problems
- Cannot even read the whole data. Sol: sub-linear time algorithms
- Cannot afford storing the data. Sol: streaming algorithms
- Single processor does not suffice. Sol: map-reduce algorithms

Tasks
- Searching through the data, e.g. nearest neighbor
- Efficient summary, e.g. summary statistics

Techniques
- Sampling, importance sampling
- Dimensionality reduction
