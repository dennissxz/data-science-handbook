# Regression

Typical approach of regression:

- design a feature mapping / representation $\boldsymbol{\phi} : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} ^d$

- minimize squared loss for a linear model $y = \boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{\phi} (\boldsymbol{x})$  

The model complexity is driven by choice of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$.
