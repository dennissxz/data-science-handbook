# Regression

In this section we introduce traditional statistical regression models. Depending on the type of data, we may use different models.

- Continuous

  - ordinary least squares

  - survival time, e.g. time
    - proportional hazard model

- Discrete

  - non-negative integer, e.g. count
    - Poisson log-linear model

  - binary
    - logistic regression

  - multi-class
    - multinomial logit model
    - ordinal logit model
    - nested logit model

- Censored

  - Tobit model
