# Algorithms Basics


## Proof

Two steps of correctness proof

- feasibility: satisfy the constraints
- optimality: better than any other solution

To prove feasibility, we just check whether the constraints are satisfied. To prove optimality, there are many approaches.

- $OPT$ gradually approaches out solution $S$, e.g. by induction

## Simplification

Try to think some reasonable assumptions to transform the original problem setting into a simpler setting.
If the optimal solution under the new setting corresponds to an optimal solution under the original setting, then the transformation is valid.


## Graph Basics

- Forest: a graph that is not connected and have no cycles


## Charing Scheme
