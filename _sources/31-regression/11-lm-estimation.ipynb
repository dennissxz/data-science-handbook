    "# Linear Models - Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "From this section we introduce linear models from a statistics’ perspective. There are three sections in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first section covers the model fundamentals, including assumptions, estimation, interpretation and some exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The next section introduce statistical inference for linear models, such as distribution of the estimated coefficients, $t$-test, $F$-test, etc. Usually machine learning community focuses more on prediction, less on inference. But inference does matters. It analyzes how important each variable is in the model from a rigorous approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third section introduce some issues in linear models, e.g. omitted variables bias, multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity, and some alternative models, e.g. Lasso, ridge regression, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition,dropdown,note} Statistics’ perspective vs social science’s perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction from econometrics’ perspective or social science’s perspective may be different. In short, the statistics’ perspective focuses on general multivariate cases and heavily rely on linear algebra for derivation, while the econometrics’ or the social science’s perspective prefers to introduce models in univariate cases by basic arithmetics (whose form can be complicated without linear algebra notations) and extend the intuitions and conclusions into multivariate cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I involved in four courses that introduced linear models, i.e. at undergrad/grad level offered by stat/social science department. The style of the two courses offered by the stat departments were quite alike while the graduate level one covered more topics. In both undergrad/grad level courses offered by the social science departments, sometimes I got confused by the course materials that were contradictory to my statistics training , but the instructors had no clear response or even no response at all...\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, to fully understand the most fundamental and widely used statistical model, I highly suggest to take a linear algebra course first and take the regression course offered by math/stat department.\n",

    "In natural science, researchers design $n\\times p$ values in the design matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ and run experiments to obtain the response $y_i$. We call this kind of data **experimental data**. In this sense, the explanatory variables $x_{ij}$’s are designed before the experiment, so they are also constants. The coefficients $\\beta_j$’s are unknown constants. The error term $\\varepsilon_i$ is random. The response variable $Y_i$ on the left hand side is random due to the randomness in the error term $\\varepsilon_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In social science, most of data is **observational data**. That is, researchers obtain the values of many variables at the same time, and choose one of interest to be the response variable $y_i$ and some others to be the explanatory variables $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In this case, $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is viewed as a data set, and we can talk about descriptive statistics, such as variance of each explanatory variable, or covariance between pair of explanatory variables. This is valid since we often view the columns of a data set as random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the inference methods of the coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ are developed based on the natural science setting, i.e., the values of explanatory variables are pre-designed constants. Many social science courses frequently use descriptive statistics of the explanatory variables which assumes they are random, and apply inference methods which assumes they are constant. This is quite confusing for beginners to linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, we stick to the natural science setting and make the second assumption below. We use subscript $i$ in every $y_i, x_i, \\varepsilon_i$ instead of $y, x, \\varepsilon$ which gives a sense that $x$ is random. And we use descriptive statistics for the explanatory variables only when necessary.\n",

    "2.  The values of explanatory variables $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ are known and fixed. Randomness only comes from $\\varepsilon_i$.\n",

    "3.  No $X_j$ is constant for all observations. No exact linear relationships among the explanatory variables (aka no perfect multicollinearity, or the design matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is of full rank).\n",

    "4.  The error terms are uncorrelated $\\operatorname{Cov}\\left( \\varepsilon_i, \\varepsilon_j \\right)= 0$, with common mean $\\operatorname{E}\\left( \\varepsilon_i \\right) = 0$ and variance $\\operatorname{Var}\\left( \\varepsilon_i \\right) = \\sigma^2$ (homoskedasticity).\n",
    "\n",
