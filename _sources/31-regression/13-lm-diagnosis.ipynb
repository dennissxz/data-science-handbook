    "\n",
    "If missing depends on $Y$, Consider the following cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If some upper value $y_i > c$ is missing, then for the remaining observations with $\\boldsymbol{x}_i ^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = c$, their error must be $\\varepsilon < 0$, to ensure $y_i < c$ to be selected. Consequently, the assumption that $\\operatorname{E}\\left( \\varepsilon_i \\right) = 0$ no longer hold for such $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hence, the estimates $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ will be **biased** since $\\operatorname{E}\\left( \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}  \\right) \\ne 0$.\n",

    "2. If some middle value $\\left\\vert y_i -\\mu _y\\right\\vert < c$ is missing, will the estimates be unbiased?\n",
    "\n",
    "    This depends. Consider an extreme case that $Y = 10X + \\varepsilon$ and we only have three kinds of covariates values $X= 1,2,3$, so there are three data clouds of equal sizes (assumed). Then dropping $\\left\\vert Y -20 \\right\\vert < 1$ and using the remaining two data clouds to run OLS, we will still get $E(\\tilde{\\beta}_1)=1$, which is unbiased.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, this selection criteria can be viewed as a combination of an upper dropping and a lower dropping, so bias is also possible under certain cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depends on $X$ (Exogenous)\n",

    "If missing depends on $X$, then we miss part of the data.\n",

    "```{margin} Non-linear true model\n",

One example is $Y = X^2 + \\varepsilon$ where $X \\sim U(-1,1)$, where we will obtain $E(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = 0$, and after removing $X<0$, we will obtain $\\operatorname{E}\\left( \\widetilde{\\beta_1} \\right) > 0$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- In terms of unbiasedness, we only observe some parts of the hyperplane, with the same local slope as the overall hyperplane. Hence, the estimates are still **unbiased**.\n",
