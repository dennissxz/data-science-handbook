# Polynomial Reduction

Polynomial reduction from problem y to problem x.

Black-box access to problem X:

algorithm for problem y can write inputs to problem x for each such input int gets a solution to problem x in 1 time step.

Time to write down input to problem x is counted in the run time for problem y

$\exists$ polynomial-reduction from y to x (y \le_p x) iff $\exists$ an algorithm for problem $y$ that solves it efficiently, given black-box access to problem $x$.
